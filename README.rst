Build & Style The UI
Step 1
Style the BODY element with a white background color

Create a DIV and give it a data-cart-info attribute. Inside the DIV, create a HEADING with mdc-typography--headline4" as its CSS class

The HEADING should have 2 SPAN elements. The First displays a shopping cart by setting its class to material-icons and setting its content to shopping_cart. The second SPAN has an attribute of data-bill and will be used to display the total figure the user is trying to pay on the app

After the data-cart-info DIV, create another DIV, give it an attribute of data-credit-card and set its class to mdc-card and mdc-card--outlined Within the data-credit-card DIV, create a new DIV with a class of mdc-card__primary-action These elements will be styled with the look and feel of an actual credit card!

Within the .mdc-card__primary-action DIV, create an IMAGE with an attribute of data-card-type and set its SRC to https://placehold.it/120x60.png?text=Card. This IMAGE will be used to display the credit card type, based on the series of numbers entered by the user

Right after the IMAGE, create a DIV with an attribute of data-cc-digits. It should contain four INPUT text fields, each with a size of 4 and a placeholder of ---- (4 dashes). These fields will be used to collect the credit numbers

Create a DIV with an attribute of data-cc-info as a sibling to the data-cc-digits DIV. This new DIV should have two INPUT text fields, one for entering the card holder's name while the other will be for the card's expiry date. The first field should have a size of 20 and a placeholder of Name Surname. The expiry date field should have a size of 6 and a placeholder of MM/YY - indicating the expiry date format.

We are now done with the structure of the credit card component. Let's make a button to allow the user make payment with the card details

Create a BUTTON as a sibling to the data-credit-card DIV. Set the BUTTON's class to mdc-button and give it a data-pay-btn attribute. It should have Pay & Checkout Now as its display text. After the user enters details of the card and clicks on this button, the app will strike-though the card numbers to indicate that they are in-valid.
Step 2
While we might have the right structure in place, the app visually tells a different story. Time to make the app look good and usable.

SPAN elements within the data-cart-info DIV should be displayed as inline block elements, and vertical-align set to middle. The .material-icons SPAN should have a 150 pixels size of font.

Give the data-credit-card DIV 435px width, 240px minimum height, 10px rounded borders, and a #5d6874 background colour.

Display the data-card-type IMAGE as a block element. Give it a 120px width and a 60px height.

The data-cc-digits DIV should have a 2em top margin.

INPUT elements in the data-cc-digits DIV should have a white color, 2em font size and line height, no border or background, and a right margin of 0.5em;

The data-cc-info DIV should have a 1em top margin.

INPUT elements in the data-cc-info DIV should have a white color, 1.2em font size, no border and no background. The second input should also have a right padding of 10px and be floated to the right of the viewport.

The data-pay-btn BUTTON should have a fixed position, 90% width, solid border of 1px and positioned 20px from the bottom of the viewport.

Your app should look functional at this point.







STAGE2 CHALLENGES AND guilds


Get The Bill
Write all Javascript strictly with ES6. This means use arrow functions instead of the function keyword. Declare variables and functions with const or let. Use const by default, and only use let if you are sure you need to re-assign values to the said variable. Use the Selector API instead of the getElementBy... or getElementsBy... APIs. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_object_model/Locating_DOM_elements_using_selectors

Install the JSON Viewer Chrome extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en), open a new tab and go to this URL (https://randomapi.com/api/006b08a801d82d0c9824dcfdfdfa3b3c). You will be making HTTP requests to that API endpoint, so spend some time looking at the structure of the response data.

Step 1
Create an appState variable and assign it an empty Object literal. This variable will hold data for the app.

Create a formatAsMoney function. It should take in an amount and a buyerCountry parameter. It will use these parameters to format the user's bill as a proper currency.

Create detectCardType, validateCardExpiryDate, and validateCardHolderName functions. Each should take in a parameter and use object de-structuring to obtain the target property of the parameter.

Create a uiCanInteract function. It will be called to setup the UI like adding event handlers to enable interactions with the app.

Create a displayCartTotal function. It should expect a parameter and should use object de-structuring to obtain results property of the parameter. This function will be called with the data from an API call and it will display the total payment bill.

Step 2
Create a fetchBill function. It should assign https://randomapi.com/api/006b08a801d82d0c9824dcfdfdfa3b3c to an api variable. It should then use the browser's fetch function to make a HTTP request to api. Using an arrow function in a .then call to the fetch function, return the response after converting it to JSON. Using an arrow function in another .then call to the first one, take the converted JSON data in a data parameter and call displayCartTotalwith it. Make sure to handle errors that may occur, e.g by showing a warning message in the console.

Call the fetchBill function from inside startApp.

Step 3
In displayCartTotal, de-structure the first item in the results array into a data variable. Next, use object de-structuring to obtain the itemsInCart and buyerCountry properties of data.

Set appState.items to itemsInCart and set appState.country to buyerCountry

Use the Array .reduce function to calculate the total bill from itemsInCart Note that each item has a qty property indicating how many of that item the user bought. Assign the calculated bill to appState.bill

Go back to the formatAsMoney function. Use the .toLocaleString function on its amount and buyerCountry to format amount as a currency with the currency symbol of buyerCountry. The countries and their currency symbols are in the countries array you got in your starter code. If the buyerCountry is not in countries, then use United States and the country and format the currency accordingly.

back to where you left off in displayCartTotal, use the formatAsMoney function to set appState.billFormatted to the formatted total bill. The already assigned appState.bill and appState.country should come be handy now!

Set the text content of the data-bill SPAN to the formatted bill set in appState.billFormatted

Finally, call uiCanInteract to wrap up displayCartTotal

Run the app (click the play button) and see if the correct formatted bill is displayed in the UI. Next, we will allow input and interaction so that users can provide payment information.




STAGE3 CHALLENGES AND GUILDS


Allow Payment
Step 0
Changes were made to the grading for this challenge. To ensure you pick up the most recent updates, click the play button to save your existing work, then hard reload your browser by doing the following : (a) open chrome developer tools (b) click and hold down the browser's refresh button to reveal a menu of 3 options (c) select the last menu option

In your CSS, change the .is-visa {...} selector to [data-credit-card].is-visa {...} . Do same for .is-mastercard {...} change it to [data-credit-card].is-mastercard {..}

Step 1
Create a flagIfInvalid function just after formatAsMoney function. This function is used to mark an input entry as invalid (strike-though) nor not. It should take a field and isValid parameters. If isValid is true, it should remove the is-invalid class from field, otherwise it should add it to field.

Just after flagIfInvalid function, create a expiryDateFormatIsValid function which takes a target parameter representing the card's expiry date field. It should return true if the field's value complies with the MM/YY format, otherwise it should return false.

With the above utility functions out of the way, go back to the validateCardExpiryDate function. It's de-structured target parameter will be the card's expiry date field. This function should return true if the value provided matches the MM/YY format (hint: delegate to expiryDateFormatIsValid) AND if the date is in the future. In either case, it should use the flagIfInvalid function to mark the field as valid or not. It then has to return true or false depending on if the validation requirements are met or not.

Now to the validateCardHolderName function. It's de-structured target parameter will be the card holder's name. Recall that its placeholder already suggests the required format, which is Name Surname (2 names separated by space). Each name should be at least 3 characters long. It should use the flagIfInvalid function to mark the field as valid or not and then return true or false depending on if the validation requirements are met or not.

Step 2
The uiCanInteract function will wire up event handling for PayCard

In the uiCanInteract function

Set detectCardType as the blur event listener for the first INPUT element in the data-cc-digits DIV.

Set validateCardHolderName as the blur event listener for the first INPUT element (card holder's name) in the data-cc-info DIV.

Set validateCardExpiryDate as the blur event listener for the second INPUT element (card expiry field) in the data-cc-info DIV.

Set validateCardNumber as the click event listener for the data-pay-btn BUTTON

Give focus to the first INPUT element in the data-cc-digits DIV.

Step 3
The detectCardType function displays a Visa or MasterCard logo depending on the card number entered by the user. For simplicity sake, our Visa card numbers begin with 4 and MasterCard numbers begin with 5. These are the only supported credit cards in the PayCard app

Sample valid card numbers for your tests:
Visa:
4556372551434601
4916337563926287
4716361721613449
4539818898404311
4929416075118388

MasterCard:
5130752529459529
5250457226640843
5330664490375584
5241343263959571
5250445524664938
Create a validateCardNumber function above the uiCanInteract function.

The detectCardType function has a de-structured target parameter which represents the first (of four) input field containing the first 4 digits of the card. If it detects a Visa card, it should add a is-visa CSS class to the data-credit-card DIV, else it should remove it to add a is-mastercard class instead, and vice versa. This gives the card a somewhat branded feel. To display the right card logo, detectCardType should set the src of the data-card-type IMAGE using the properties in the supportedCards object, which map to image data URLs for each type of card. Finally, detectCardType needs to return the is-visa or is-mastercard string value depending on the type of card detected

Try filling in some details into the credit card UI and see if your validation code for the card holder's name and expiry date are working as stipulated. Does your detectCardType function also correctly set the right background color for the credit card component and display the right logo as well?



STAGE4 CHALLENGES AND GUILDS

Validate Card Number
To have gotten this far, you are definitely a rockstar.



A number of changes and improvements were made to challenge specifications, and will require you to hard reload your browser to be on the latest build: (a) open Chrome developer tools (b) click and hold down the browser's refresh button to reveal a menu of 3 options (c) select the last menu option

The progress indicator (numbered buttons on the left) might move you a previous step. Don't panic. We updated some aspects of the instructions and audits, so you'll have to modify your code a bit

You will be implementing the The Luhn Algorithm to validate credit card numbers (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm for more details), but follow the instructions below for simplicity.

Given a series of up to 16 digits, from the right to left, double every other digit starting with the second to last digit:

1714
=> [1*, 7, 1*, 4]
=> [2, 7, 2, 4]
If a resulting doubled number is greater than 9, replace it with either the sum of its own digits, or 9 subtracted from it.

[8, 18*, 1] 
=> [8, (1+8), 1]
OR
=> [8, (18-9), 1]
Resulting in:
=> [8, 9, 1]
Sum all of the final digits:

[8, 9, 1] 
=> 8+9+1 
=> 18
Finally, take that sum and divide it by 10. If there is no remainder, the original credit card number is valid, else it is not valid.

Time for you algorithm implementation. Recall that the validateCardNumber function is called when the user clicks on the Pay & Checkout Now button

Step 1
Create a validateWithLuhn function above the validateCardNumber function. It should take a digits parameter which will represent the credit card numbers as an array of 16 integers. It should return true or false depending on if the digits are valid or not, including if it got more or less than 16 digits or a mixture of digits and invalid characters.
Step 2
Implement validateCardNumber to validate the card numbers entered by the user. It delegates to the validateWithLuhn function for the actual validation and returns the true or false value it gets from validateWithLuhn. Before returning the outcome of the validation, it should also indicate that the entries are invalid or valid by adding or removing the is-invalid class to the data-cc-digits DIV respectively, depending on the validity of the card number.
Step 3
You don't want the user paying the wrong bill because you've calculated it wrongly or presented it in the wrong currency

Make sure what is set to appState.bill is correctly calculated by summing the prices of the items the user bought. Don't forget that each item has a quantity, which affects the price!

Make sure that appState.billFormattedhas the currency of the user's country and only uses the dollar currency if the user's country is not available within the provided list of countries.

Try filling in some payment details into the PayCard app, then click the Pay & Checkout Now BUTTON to see if the entered card numbers are correctly marked as invalid or not.
